# Python Programming with Rasterio
## Assignment
In this assignment you will learn about the `rasterio` library. You will use a Landsat scene stores in a public AWS bucket. 


### Background
[`rasterio`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the most popular python library for reading and manipulating geospatial raster datasets. The `gdal` wrapper for python is also widely used but `rasterio` is considered more "pythonic". 

### Instructions
For this assignment we will be following the tutorial at https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/04-workingwithrasters/. As you work through this tutorial, take snapshots of your Spyder workspace at the following intermediate products. 

- `screencap_windowed_landsat.png`: workspace with a preview of the Landsat scene with a window named 
- `ndvi.png`: workspace showing NDVI 
- `diff_ndvi.png: workspace showing two NDVIs and their difference
- 
Be sure your snapshot shows the last graphic produced.

### Deliverables

You should have 3 screenshots. Include those in a branch named `rasterio` and submit a `Pull request` to merge with `master`. Do not merge!
